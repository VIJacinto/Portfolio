					<h3>My Online Gambling Addiction</h3>
					<p>This was years ago when online gambling and virtual money was less of a problem at my place. I officially quit in some time not because I was expending actual money on it, I just got bored with it.</p>

				<h3>My Best Friend's Debut</h3>

				<h3>Clinical Checkup</h3>
				<p>One time, me and my mother suspected that I had dengue (mosquito occurring illness) so we tried to get a quick checkup on their clinic. Turns out all I had was a room and a negative result on my blood report.</p>

				<h3>Junior High Getting High</h3>
				<p>Not in the literal sense, during this time they believed that senior high was the next big thing for them. Thus revealing the "getting high" part as moving up to the world. But for me, its just another day of finding personal documents for a new school.</p>

				<h3>Visiting the Bay</h3>
				<p>This was during my freshie days at senior high, I realized that Manila Bay has been officially reopened and rennovated for more tourist attractions. Therefore, I naturally waited for my friends to ask me out and voila, a group pic. </p>
