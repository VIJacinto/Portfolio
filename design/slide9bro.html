				<div class="spec-title">Processor (CPU): AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</div>
				<div class="spec-description">
					I just want the latest CPU, especially if its an AMD. I was thinking about Intel but to my surprise, their performance on their latest CPU models are 20% slower than than AMD models.

			<div class="spec-card">
				<div class="spec-title">DDR5 RAM 32GB</div>
				<div class="spec-description">
					I mean, 16 gigabytes is fine but if I am dealing with multithreading and a latest CPU, then I should pair it with a good RAM for volatile storage.
				</div>

			<div class="spec-card">
				<div class="spec-title">1TB - 10TB storage</div>
				<div class="spec-description">
					I do not use too much space, just enough to cover files and games. I mean, the delete and download prompts are there for a reason am I right.

			<div class="spec-card">
				<div class="spec-title">RTX 5090 GPU</div>
				<div class="spec-description">
					I always have a good monitor but not a good graphics card to pair with so I think it is natural to pair the two when buyiong a gaming computer.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="spec-card">
				<div class="spec-title">MSI or GIGABYTE Motherboards</div>
				<div class="spec-description">
					Of course I would choose the latest, its the company I am surprised about, especially when MSI started making their own GPU models for NVIDIA. GIGABYTE has been the reliable motherboard for me as it is flexible for various form factors such as the size itself, DDR model choice, etc. In short its, detailed customizability.

			<div class="spec-card">
				<div class="spec-title">750 - 850 Power Supply Unit</div>
				<div class="spec-description">
					Based on past research, the higher the specs of a computer, the more wattage power it demands from its PSU.
