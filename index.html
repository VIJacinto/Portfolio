    <p class="anime">Hello world, or should I say viewer? I don't know, but anyways, welcome to my webpage! Its been a long time since I saw someone clicking through this folder and I am grateful to you for clicking and having the will to spend some precious time of yours on what this webpage is all about. See that guy on the right? Yep, that's me, the man responsible for creating this atrocity that people call a "resume." Nonetheless, this is a project for college and it may be a special add-on for my own webpage once I land a job (I know that is not how it works, but please bear with me). If you want to know more about me then you may follow through in my resume and get to know much more of who you're talking with. </p>
