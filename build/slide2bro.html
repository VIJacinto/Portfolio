            I am actually a bit happier here, you know? A time where if you have an assignment, you can just tell your mom when she's already asleep. Kidding aside, this is really where my childhood memories were made because I was always excited in attending classes and have fun at the same time.

          I was happy while I was here at this school; I have experienced a lot of things here like social interaction, insults, friendships, leadership, and group projects. Floor wax and brooms aren't common here anymore, so I really had to study hard.

          When I got into this school I was so proud of myself, not because of the fact that I got into my dream school but because this was also my family's dreams school, they wanted me here and knowing that I got the opportunity, they were astounded by it. However, when I got in I was in quite for a culture shock, there are so many activities coming from the minor subjects, more vacant and sleepy time from the major subjects. Therefore, the rumours about college life are true.
